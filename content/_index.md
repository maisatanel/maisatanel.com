## Hi, I'm Lina!

This is my personal blog page to post long-form articles about stuff I like.

### About me

I'm 20 years old. I use she/her pronouns.

I'm currently hopping inbetween countries, looking for a permanent place to stay.

I speak English in a funny way.

### Tech

I like messing around with Linux, particularly in the desktop space. I'm mostly using a Mac though.

I'm a "DevOps engineer", at least it says so in my job description. Still unsure as to what that means.
